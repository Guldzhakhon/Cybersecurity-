I am deeply passionate about cybersecurity, a trait evident in my continuous quest for knowledge in the domain. 
Prior to undertaking the Google cybersecurity certificate, which I completed in just one month, I had been rigorously preparing for the CompTIA Security+ exam, using resources like Professor Messer's videos and practicing through Udemy. 
Alongside this, my preparation for the SC-200 exam further deepened my understanding. 
My earlier SOC analyst training was a cornerstone, providing a sturdy foundation in both theory and hands-on lab scenarios. 
Additionally, my practical experience at the MSP seamlessly integrated with many of the certification's tasks. 
This blend of formal training, on-the-job application, and my undying zeal to stay updated has profoundly shaped my proficiency in the cybersecurity realm.
